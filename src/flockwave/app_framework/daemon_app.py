        Extensions *may* have a dictionary named ``exports`` that allows the
        extension to export some of its variables, functions or methods.
        Other extensions may access the exported members of an extension by
        calling the `import_api`_ method of the application.

        This function supports "lazy imports", i.e. one may import the API
        of an extension before loading the extension. When the extension
        is not loaded, the returned API object will have a single property
        named ``loaded`` that is set to ``False``. When the extension is
        loaded, the returned API object will set ``loaded`` to ``True``.
        Attribute retrievals on the returned API object are forwarded to the
        API of the extension.

        Parameters:
            extension_name: the name of the extension whose API is to
                be imported

        Returns:

            retrievals to the API, except for the property named ``loaded``,
            which returns whether the extension is loaded or not.
